		<h1>Who invented 3D printing?</h1>
		<p><span class="highlight">Chuck Hull</span> was the founder of 3D Systems and is widely considered to be the inventor of 3D printing. He was the first to patent the technology and <span class="highlight">developed the first 3D printing system</span>. Hull’s invention was based on the idea of using a <span class="highlight">laser</span> to create <span class="highlight">three-dimensional objects</span> from photosensitive resin.</p>

		<h1>The first 3D printer</h1>
		<h2>SLA-1</h2>
		<p>The SLA-1 is the first 3D printer manufactured for commercial sale and use. This system pioneered the rapid development of additive manufacturing, a method in which <span class="highlight">material is added layer-by-layer, to form a solid obiect</span>, as <span class="highlight">opposed</span> to traditional manufacturing in which <span class="highlight">material is cut or machined away</span>. The SLA-1 is based on stereolithography, using a <span class="highlight">precisely controlled beam of ultraviolet light to solidify liquid polymers one layer at a time</span>.
 Charles hull developed stereolithography in <span class="highlight">1983</span> and formed 3D systems to manufacture and market a commercial printer. 3D printers based on hull's design are now widely used to make complex components in a wide variety of materials.</p>
		<p>The SLA-1 looked like this:</p>

		<h1>My 3D printer</h1>
		<h2>Prusa MINI+</h2>
		<p>I have a printer from the brand <span class="highlight">Prusa</span>. It is the model Prusa <span class="highlight">MINI+</span>. I recommend Prusa printers because they are <span class="highlight">very easy to use</span>, for example they have <span class="highlight">automatic bed-leveling</span> and there are <span class="highlight">lots of different models</span>. There are <span class="highlight">FDM</span> printers, <span class="highlight">SLA</span> printers and printers that can print with <span class="highlight">multiple colors at once</span>. Prusa also has their <span class="highlight">own website where you can download free 3d models</span> and they have their <span class="highlight">own filament named Prusament</span>.</p>
		<p>This is the Prusa MINI+:</p>
